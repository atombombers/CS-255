* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass, a company focused on helping students pass DMV driving tests. They wanted a cloud-based system for managing online classes, practice tests, driving lesson reservations, and customer/employee interactions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well analyzing the client’s needs and breaking them down into clear system requirements. I also did well capturing the different user roles and how their access and responsibilities should be managed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise my UML diagrams, since the free version of Lucidchart limited my ability to go into full detail that I wish I could've. I would improve them by adding deeper relationships, constraints, and interactions that show a more complete system design.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by mapping each requirement to specific use cases and system features. Considering user needs is essential because it ensures the final system supports real business operations and prevents wasted resources on features that don’t matter to the client.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software by starting with requirement gathering, then moving into use cases, diagrams, and incremental validation with the client. In the future, I would continue using UML and GANTT charts and also integrate prototyping and user feedback to refine the design.
